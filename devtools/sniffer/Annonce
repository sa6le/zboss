ZBOSS Sniffer - open source cross-platform ZigBee packet sniffer.
On the hardware side sniffer is developed for TI SmartRf05EB and CC2531 USB Dongle. Packets are sent to PC via RS-232 interface
when using board and via usb when using dongle (virtual serial port is emulated). Sniffer for hardware is provided in two forms:
1) ready-to-use images for SmartRf05Eb and CC2531 USB Dongle;
2) sniffer can be compiled from ZBOSS sources using ZB_SNIFFER define (special IAR project is included into sources). 
On the PC side, cross-platform Qt application is running, receiving packets from the hardware and providing them to Wireshark
via local socket. Also sniffer application manages Wireshark itself (start, connect and disconnect). Wireshark controls are available 
for sniffer managing too.
We provide two binary packets with ZBOSS Sniffer ready to use out-of-the-box: on Windows XP/Vista/7 and on Ubuntu 12.04 - 13.10 
(other options with these OS weren't tested). In addition, sniffer can be compiled from sources with Qt.      
For use with ZBOSS sniffer plain Wireshark downloaded from official site suits. Also patched Wireshark provided by DSR can be used to
recognize more packet types.
