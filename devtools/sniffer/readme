ZBOSS Sniffer sources archive contains sources of two sniffer parts: hardware and PC GUI.

GUI sources are lying under "gui" folder and provided with Qt Creator project. GUI was developed with qt5 library.
Notice, that to build gui you need "qtserialport" installed. It could be found in "Addons" tab when installing Qt
using Qt GUI Installer.

Hardware sources are in "hw" folder. To work with them they should be placed in the stack/devtools/sniffer folder in 
ZBOSS stack (stack already contains support for ZBOSS Sniffer). ZBOSS Stack can be found here:

Hardware sources are provided with IAR project which should be placed under ZBOSS stack root directory and
added to the ZBOSS IAR workspace (provided with ZBOSS stack).
